"Notes:

(1) Confidence limit and confidence interval refer to the statistical confidence that the true value will fall between the upper and lower limit based on how well the forecasting model fits the historic data. For county-level forecasts, the confidence intervals/limits represent the 80% confidence level.  For region-level forecasts, the confidence intervals/limits are the sum of the county-level intervals, therefore the confidence  level is unspecified.  The confidence intervals/limits do not account for any non-historic factors - such as expected economic developments - which may be included in the forecast, therefore it is possible that the forecast may exceed the confidence limits in some situations.",
